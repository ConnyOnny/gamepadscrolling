This is a [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) script to allow scrolling on any website with your Gamepad. It is successfully tested with the Xbox 360 gamepad on Firefox 49. For other gamepads you might need to change the axes indices to get the scroll directions right.

Other browsers should also work, as this project is a fork of *the* gamepad boilerplate code: https://github.com/luser/gamepadtest
